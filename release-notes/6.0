*** Squeak 6.0 Release Notes ***TBD (summary)Please find below a detailed listing of all the changes, which includes notes on Major Deprecations, Known Issues, and Compatibility Notes at the bottom.    /^(o.o)^\  /^(o.o)^\  /^(o.o)^\  /^(o.o)^\  /^(o.o)^\ Detailed Improvements in Language, Tools, and the Environment~~~ Core Language ~~~Kernel (up to Kernel-ct.1453)- Switches the default bytecode set to SistaV1. This lays the basis for a new generation of VM optimizations (Sista: Speculative Inlining Smalltalk Architecture). With Sista, blocks are represented by CompiledBlocks and instantiated as FullBlockClosures, stability of which has been improved in the course of this switch (fixed bugs in FullBlockClosure >> #= and InstructionStream >> #scanForInstructionSequence:).- Adds full support for read-only objects that is backed by a VM-side write barrier bit. If an attempt is made to manipulate a read-only object, a ModificationForbidden error will be signaled. Some objects are read-only by default.- Numbers: Adds new testing selectors Number >> #hasLimitedPrecision and Float >> #isDenormal. Accelerates SmallInteger >> #highBit by connecting it to a new VM primitive. Adds utiliies for converting floats from/into IEEE representations. Fixes bugs in Float >> #isPowerOfTwo, Float >> #log2, LargePositiveInteger >> #sqrt, and SmallInteger >> #sqrt.- Simulation and debugging: Completion and fixes for the simulation of Objects as Methods, #doesNotUnderstand:, and several bytecodes and primitives. Protects the simulation machinery against internal simulator errors which previously could blow up your image. Upgrades Context class >> #runSimulated: to a synchronous entry point into the simulator.- Process management: Makes Process more robust against invalid instantiation and termination attempts. Fixes several bugs in reading the state of processes and terminating them. In particular, reinforces that all unwind (#ensure:) contexts will be executed during termination which may include the top context of the process. Adds #terminateAggressively to skip all active unwind contexts. Fixes bugs in ProcessorScheduler >> #highestPriority: and ProcessorScheduler >> #anyProcessesAbove:. Improves convenience of Process >> #printString.- Bugfixes and improved robustness during exception handling.- BlockClosure: Adds #whileNil, revises return values of #whileNil: and #valueWithExit.- Fixes some implementations of #copy.- Work continues on streamlining ProtoObject and making it understand as few messages as possible.- Switches identity forwarding to not copy the hash by default.- Work continues on improving compatibility of Promise with the Promise/A+ specification.- Adds a #defaultBase: parameter to NumberParser.- In #caseOf:otherwise:, adds support for unary otherwise blocks.- Simplifies the compilation protocol on ClassDescription. Robustizes decompilation against syntax errors. Adds utility methods on SharedPool and on CompiledMethod.- Adds a new preference for turning off logging of compilations to changes file.- Revises some event sensor constants and fixes the timestamps of synthetized events.- Work continues on decoupling Kernel from UI frameworks.- Improves weak typing of collections for math functions.- Softly deprecates #ifNotNilDo:, #ifNil:ifNotNilDo: and #ifNotNilDo:ifNil:; please switch to their pendants without 'Do'.- Miscellaneous speed-ups (#cull:[cull:], Integer rounding) and clean-ups (ByteSetEncoder, ClassBuilder, source pointers, minor deprecations).Collections (up to Collections-ul.1002)- Subsumes all non-pointer array classes under the new superclass RawBitsArray: splits up FloatArray into Float32Array and the new VM-optimized Float64Array; extracts superclass UnsignedIntegerArray from [Double]ByteArray and [Double]WordArray; extracts RawBitsArray from UnsignedIntegerArray, ColorArray, and FloatArray. Adds Signed variants for UnsignedIntegerArray and all subclasses.- Increases precision of intervals of floats by extracting new subclass LimitedPrecisionInterval.- Improves compatibility of Streams with the Collection protocol.- Adds new capabilities to the collection hierarchy: There are now Collection >> #symmetricDifference: and SequenceableCollection >> #indicesOfSubCollection:[startingAt:].- Adds Collection >> #sortedSafely and Dictionary >> #replace:, #withKeysSorted:, and #withKeysSortedSafely.- Implements removal on RunArray.- Improves stability of SharedQueues and lets them understand #peekLast.- Adds convenience protocol for enumerating SparseLargeTables.- Updates the list of character constants and separators.- Adds convenience selectors on Text for removing or replacing attributes and configuring fonts.- Improves polymorphy between Text and String.- To HtmlReadWriter, adds support for <img> tags and improves support for <font> tags.- Refactors TranscriptStream implementation and fixes the redirectToStdout mode.- Refactors initialization and clean-up of collections and symbols.- Deprecates SequenceableCollection >> #doWithIndex: and #collectWithIndex: in favor of #withIndexDo: and #withIndexCollect:.- Overall improvements to stability, performance, test coverage, and documentation.Chronology (up to Chronology-Core-ul.55)- Automatically updates the image time zone every 30 minutes.- Honor nanoseconds in Time >> #addSeconds: and DateAndTime >> #printString:.- Extends DateAndTime class >> #readFrom: to accept offset strings without a colon according to the RFC 822 specification.- Adds precise #busyWait on Delay as an alternative to the existing idle #wait.- Provides Time class >> #millisecondClock and DateAndTime class >> #millisecondClock (no 45-daily roll-over).- Deprecates #totalSeconds and #millisecondClockValue on DateAndTime; use Time class >> #millisecondClock instead.- Changes Number >> #second to no longer trim off the magnitude of the receiver. That is, 3 second now equals 3 seconds (plural).Compiler (up to Compiler-eem.472)- All compiled literals will now be read-only objects.- Fixes text selection during interactive error handling; decouples the parser from the requesting UI frameworks.- Allows to cancel compilation if an unused variable is detected.- Changes the default return value of a do-it from nil to self.- Extends parser hooks to be used by FFI or similar for parsing custom pragmas and external function declarations.

Users should move away from Morph >> #(handle|wants)dropFiles to use #acceptDroppingMorph:event: and #wantsDroppedMorph:event: and to check #dragTransferType for #filesAndDirectories.Known Issues- Process termination is currently buggy and will silently drop the process if some unwind contexts signal an unhandled error. See: [squeak-dev] Solving multiple termination bugs - summary & proposal.- When you abandon a debugger from within an unwind context, execution of the unwind context will be continued. See: [squeak-dev] The semantics of halfway-executed unwind contexts during process termination.- Lookbehinds in regular expression are not yet considered stable. Inserting them into a nullable closure currently causes a MessageNotUnderstood error. Also, matching is not optimized and currently has a quadratic runtime complexity.Compatibility Notes- In SyntaxErrorNotification, #resume: was renamed to #retryWithNewSource: to clarify that the control flow will not just resume but compilation will be retried.- #asMutator is back to preserve the well-known Smalltalk legacy and improve the backward compatibility for projects such as Seaside. However, new code should use #asSimpleSetter instead.- The default value for #allowBlockArgumentAssignment is now enforced, which means disabled. Your project might have to enable this preference again if you want to assign to block arguments.- Process >> #terminate will now consistently execute all unwind contexts which may include the top context of the process. This implies that in rare cases sending #terminate to a process will not interrupt the current control flow immediately.- All code literals are read-only with the new bytecode set SistaV1. If you used to perform inline modifications such as 'hello' at: 1 put: $y or #(1 3 2) sort, you will need to copy the literal first. Brace expressions are not affected.- Identity forwarding via #becomeForward: or #elementsForwardIdentityTo: does no longer copy the hash. Append copyHash: to the selector to override the default behavior.        ("\(^.^)/")          ("\(^.^)/")          ("\(^.^)/") !!!!!!
