The files in this folder are in Squeak's text chunk file-out format. DO NOT edit them in a text editor because otherwise the text attributes, which are encoded at the end of the files, will be out of sync.

If you want to edit them, load them via the Squeak Help Browser, edit them there and file them out again.
