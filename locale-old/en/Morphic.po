"The Event Theatre provides a framework for authoring \"event-movies\".  It uses custom variants of the Navigator, the Supplies flap, the painting system, property sheets, Viewer flaps, etc., all of which reside within the controlled confines of the Theatre.\n"
"\n"
"To author an event-movie, get a  new Event Theatre from the Objects catalog or from the \"open...\" branch of the desktop menu.\n"
"\n"
"1. Resize the Theatre, using the halo, to the delivery size desired for playback.\n"
"\n"
"2. Use the menu in the controls panel to add or delete Supplies and Navigator flaps as desired.\n"
"\n"
"3. Edit the \"caption\" by clicking on the text that says \"Untitled\" and typing your desired caption.  This caption is affixed to playback buttons, and, generally, provides a way to identify the event-movie.\n"
"\n"
"4. Set up the \"initial conditions\" for the event-movie you're about to record (e.g., paint a background, provide some explanatory text, add objects you want to be present at the start of the movie.) When the recording is first opened by the user for playback, and whenever the recording has been rewound, this is exactly what it will look like.\n"
"\n"
"5. When ready to start the recording, press the \"Record\" button. A red border will be seen around the recorder, to indicate that recording is in progress.  Recording will continue until you hit the ESC key.\n"
"\n"
"6. Note that if you  want to include sound in your recording, you can add it directly during playback, or you can produce voiceover externally and add it in later using the Event Roll.\n"
"\n"
"7. Now proceed to \"do\", with the mouse and keyboard, whatever you wish to record.   For best results, all mouse gestures should be made within the interior of the Theatre.\n"
"\n"
"8. Hit ESC when done recording.\n"
"\n"
"9. To review what you've recorded, press \"Play\". If unhappy with the result, repeat steps 1-8.\n"
"\n"
"10.  If you're happy with the result, and now wish to add a sound, open the sound panel, then click Play to replay the recording, and whenever you wish to add a snippet of voiceover, click on the \"Start Recording Voiceover\" button, and start talking, and when done with that snippet click the \"Stop Recording Voiceover\" button.  Once the playback finishes, the added voiceover(s) will become part of the event tape, and will be seen in the event roll.\n"
"\n"
"11. When you're happy with the result, hit the \"Publish\" button, to get a playback button. There are currently two choices:\n"
"\n"
"a. Iconic Button - Initially provides a picture of the initial scene of the movie, scaled 0.3x, and overlaid with the word HINT.  When the user clicks on such a button, the event-movie is played back in an ephemeral \"playback theatre\", and after the playback is done, the playback theatre shrinks down to a 0.5x scale-downed picture of the *final* scene of the movie.  Subsequent hitting of the button will again invoke a playback.\n"
"\n"
"b. Textual Button - a simple labeled button which, when pressed, triggers playback of the event tape.\n"
"\n"
"12. The playback buttons you obtain when you \"Publish\" can be placed anywhere, such as on the page of a book. You can control, via a playback-button's halo menu, whether or not it should be \"auto-start\", and whether or not \"auto-dismiss\". When the user presses the button, a \"Playback\" space will open, which resembles an Event Theatre, but has only playback-relevant controls.   A playback set up for both auto-start and auto-dismiss comes without any controls.\n"
"\n"

"You can *remove* any item from an event roll by just picking it up with the mouse and dropping it anywhere outside the roll (such as on the desktop or in the trash-can.)  If in doubt about the effect of removing an item, you can put it on the desktop, play the revised tape, then pick up the event from the desktop and drop it back near where you found it in the event roll, and replay again to compare.\n"

For example, you can drop a \"Morph\" or a \"Tile\" obtained from a SoundRecorder, and you can drop a \"button\" representing another event-recorded sequence (though it is not at the moment recommended to do the latter.)  One straightforward way of adding voiceovers to an existing event recording is to play back the recording while selectively making individual snippets of voice recordings using a separate, standard Squeak SoundRecording tool.  After you are satisfied with a recording, obtain a \"morph\" from the sound-recording tool, and position it as desired in the event roll.\n"

[CAUTION:  Do not resize a mouse item such that it will overlap an adjacent one.  It is a bug that this is even allowed.]\n"
"\n"
"In addition to adding separately-recorded voiceovers using the mechanism described in item 3 above, there is a built-in voiceover mechanism in the Event Theatre.  Whenever you are playing back an existing event-recording in an Event Theatre, a \"Record Voiceover\" button will appear.  If you press this, the playback of the event recording will continue and you can record a voiceover to go with any portion you wish.  When you are done recording a snippet, you can hit the \"stop recording voiceover\" button; playback will continue, and you can subsequently, on this pass or any future one, add more voiceover snippets.  To remove a voiceover snippet, simply drag it out of the event roll; to reposition it, simply pick it up with the mouse and drop it back into the event roll at the desired position.\n"
"\n"
"When you make a change in an Event Roll, it will immediately change the tape of the Event Theatre, so that when you replay the event-movie you will immediately see see the change.  If you are unhappy with the change, there is a one-level \"undo\" available which will revert the EventTheatre to its state before the last edit you made in the EventRoll.  There is also a \"deeper\" level of \"undo\" available that will revert the EventTheatre (and hence the associated EventRoll) to the initial state they were in when you first launched the event roll.\n"
